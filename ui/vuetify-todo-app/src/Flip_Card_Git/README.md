### vue-flip-card

[demo](https://andersponders.github.io/vue-flip-card/demo/)

Generic flip card that allows for completely arbitrary content on each side. Slot-ified version of Karakanb's awesome **
vue-info-card** component, which you can find [here.](https://github.com/karakanb/vue-info-card)

## Installation

FlipCard uses vuetify with md-icons as the icon that you click to flip the cards, but you can put whatever you want in
there instead if you dont use vuetify.

## Usage

```html

<template>
    <FlipCard>
        <template slot="front">
            <span>Hey loser</span>
        </template>
        <template slot="back">
            <span>Thought u could get rid of me loser?</span>
        </template>
    </FlipCard>
</template>

<script>
    import FlipCard from 'vue-flip-card';

    export default {
        components: {
            FlipCard,
        }
    };
</script>
```

## Credits

Addtl credits from Karakanb:

The component is based on two main features: spark line and flip effect. The spark line is created with the
amazing [vuetrend](https://github.com/QingWei-Li/vue-trend) component, which creates cool and customizable graphs. The
flipping effect is implemented in pure CSS, and influenced from the tutorial [here](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip).

## Browser Support

The component supports all of the modern browsers, with least versions: Firefox 37, Chrome 42, Safari 8, Opera 29, and
IE 10.
